                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-500">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
                    <p class="mt-4">The CPU, often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. It processes data and controls other components in the system.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4"><span class="font-semibold text-xl text-blue-500">How it works:</span> The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them to understand what action is required, executes the action, and then writes back the result. This cycle is known as the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.</p>
                    <ul class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 list-disc list-inside mt-4">
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-500">Cores:</span> Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For instance, a quad-core CPU can handle four tasks at once, significantly improving multitasking and performance in multi-threaded applications.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-500">Clock Speed:</span> Measured in GHz, it determines how many cycles a CPU can perform per second. A higher clock speed means the CPU can execute instructions faster, enhancing overall performance.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-500">Cache:</span> A small amount of very fast memory on the CPU that stores frequently used data and instructions. This reduces the time needed to access data from the main memory, thus speeding up processing times.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-500">Threads:</span> Threads are the smallest unit of processing that a scheduler can manage. CPUs with Hyper-Threading or Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) can handle multiple threads per core, increasing efficiency in parallel processing.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-500">Architecture:</span> Modern CPUs use complex architectures like x86, ARM, or RISC-V, each with its own set of instructions and capabilities. These architectures define how the CPU processes data and communicates with other hardware components.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-500">RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
                    <p class="mt-4">RAM is a type of volatile memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks. It allows for fast read and write access, significantly speeding up the system's performance.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4"><span class="font-semibold text-xl text-green-500">How it works:</span> When you run a program, it is loaded from the hard drive into the RAM. The CPU can then access this data much faster than if it had to retrieve it from the hard drive each time.</p>
                    <ul class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 list-disc list-inside mt-4">
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-green-500 ">Volatility:</span> RAM loses its data when the power is turned off, which is why data needs to be saved to a non-volatile storage before shutting down. This is why unsaved work can be lost if the computer unexpectedly turns off.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-green-500">Capacity:</span> More RAM allows for more data to be stored and accessed quickly, enhancing multitasking and overall performance. Common sizes range from 4GB to 32GB or more, depending on the user's needs and applications.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-green-500">Speed:</span> Measured in MHz or GHz, it determines how fast data can be read from or written to the RAM. Faster RAM can improve the performance of memory-intensive applications like video editing, gaming, and large data processing.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-green-500">DDR (Double Data Rate):</span> Modern RAM modules use DDR technology (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, DDR5), which transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, effectively doubling the data rate.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-green-500">Latency:</span> This refers to the delay between a command and the data being available. Lower latency RAM can improve performance, especially in applications requiring quick access to large amounts of data.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-500">ROM (Read-Only Memory)</h2>
                    <p class="mt-4">ROM is a type of non-volatile memory used to store firmware, which is the software that is permanently programmed into the hardware. It is essential for booting up the system and performing basic operations.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4"><span class="font-semibold text-xl text-red-500">How it works:</span> ROM retains its data even when the computer is turned off. It typically contains the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which initializes hardware components during the startup process.</p>
                    <ul class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 list-disc list-inside mt-4">
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-red-500">Non-volatility:</span> Data stored in ROM is not lost when the power is off, making it crucial for storing essential instructions. This ensures that the system can start up and load the necessary software every time it is powered on.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-red-500">Firmware Storage:</span> ROM stores firmware that provides the necessary instructions for the hardware to communicate and operate properly. This firmware is essential for the basic functionality of devices, such as initializing hardware components and loading the operating system.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-red-500">Types:</span> Different types of ROM include PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), each with varying capabilities for data modification and storage. PROM can be written once, while EPROM and EEPROM can be erased and reprogrammed multiple times.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-red-500">Applications:</span> ROM is used in various applications, including embedded systems, consumer electronics, and computer systems. It stores firmware for devices like microcontrollers, game consoles, and medical devices.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold text-lg text-red-500">BIOS/UEFI:</span> The BIOS or UEFI stored in ROM is critical for system startup. It performs hardware initialization, checks for hardware configurations, and starts the bootloader to load the operating system.</li>
